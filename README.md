Hey, my name is @tarickali but I go by Tarick or Ricky.

I'm a computer science and combinatorics & optimization graduate from UWaterloo with a passion to solve hard and important problems using ai and rl.

Currently experimenting with some new ideas in the domain of ai/rl.

Most of my repos will be private until I am confident that they work perfectly. However, I will be releasing small updates of what I'm working on and tutorials of what I've learned at medium.com/@tarickali.

Want to know more and/or collaborate with me? You can reach me at tarickali97@gmail.com.
