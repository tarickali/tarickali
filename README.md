Hey, my name is @tarickali.

I'm a computer science and combinatorics & optimization graduate from UWaterloo with a passion to solve hard and important problems using ai and rl and currently experimenting with some new ideas in those domains.

I will be releasing small updates of what I'm working on and tutorials of what I've learned at medium.com/@tarickali. Feel free to follow me there and my twitter @itstarickali for updates!

If you want to know more and/or collaborate with me you can reach me at my twitter.
